### map, filter, forEach

**Directions:** Complete the prompts below to gauge your facility with the native versions `map()`, `filter()`, and `forEach()`.

**Problem #1:** Create a function called `filterByTagAndDecade` that takes in two parameters - `array`, `tag`, `decade`. The parameter `array` represents an array of movie objects; `tag` represents a string of a tag; `decade` represents a string of a decade (ex. "70s", "80s", "90s", "2000s", "2010s", "2020s"); This function should use the native filter method to iterate through the input array and return a new array of only the movies from the input decade that have the input tag in their tags array.
